Hereâ€™s a **three-phase development plan** for building a package manager that integrates **CAS (Content Addressable Storage)** into the processes of parsing metadata, managing dependencies, resolving them, and installation.

---

## **Phase 1: Parsing Metadata Files**

### **Objective**

Establish a metadata format and build functionality to initialize, parse, and validate metadata for a project.

### **Tasks**

1. **Define the Metadata Format**

   - Decide on the structure of the metadata file (e.g., JSON or YAML).
   - Include fields for:
     - Project name and version.
     - A list of dependencies with version ranges.
     - Optional fields for authors, license, etc.

2. **Build CLI Initialization**

   - Implement a command to generate a boilerplate metadata file (e.g., `mypkg.json`).
   - Ensure it includes placeholders for dependencies and project details.

3. **Implement Parsing and Validation**

   - Build functionality to read and validate metadata:
     - Check for required fields like project name, version, and dependencies.
     - Ensure proper formatting and structure.

4. **Setup Error Handling**
   - Add robust error handling for malformed or missing metadata files.

## **Phase 2: Managing Dependencies**

### **Objective**

Develop a system to resolve and manage dependencies while leveraging CAS for deduplication and integrity.

### **Tasks**

1. **Dependency Version Resolution**

   - Implement a resolver to match version ranges specified in the metadata file with available versions in a package repository.
   - Define rules for semantic versioning and constraints.

2. **Use CAS for Dependency Storage**

   - For each resolved dependency, retrieve its content hash from the repository.
   - Store the hash in a lockfile to ensure consistent installations across environments.
   - Fetch dependencies by hash, ensuring deduplication in local and remote storage.

3. **Dependency Tree Building**

   - Handle transitive dependencies by recursively resolving them.
   - Build a dependency tree that accounts for:
     - Conflicts between dependencies.
     - Optimized resolution of shared dependencies.

4. **Metadata Updates**
   - Implement CLI commands to modify the metadata file:
     - Add a new dependency (e.g., `mypkg add lodash@^4.0.0`).
     - Remove or update existing dependencies.
   - Ensure updates propagate to a lockfile for precise version control.

---

## **Phase 3: Installation with CAS Integration**

### **Objective**

Download, verify, and install dependencies efficiently using CAS for deduplication and integrity checks.

### **Tasks**

1. **Content Addressable Storage (CAS) Integration**

   - Establish a local cache for packages, structured by their hashes:
     - Each package is stored in a directory named after its hash.
     - Avoids duplication by reusing existing packages with the same hash.
   - Use a lockfile to map dependencies to their hashes for consistency.

2. **Package Fetching and Verification**

   - Fetch packages from the remote repository using their resolved version and hash.
   - Verify the integrity of downloaded packages by recomputing their hash.
   - Skip downloading packages already present in the local cache.

3. **Dependency Installation**

   - Extract packages from the local cache into a project-specific directory (e.g., `mypkg_modules`).
   - Maintain a structured directory for dependencies.
   - Update the lockfile to record installed versions, hashes, and paths.

4. **CLI Commands**

   - `mypkg install`: Resolve all dependencies in the metadata file and install them.
   - `mypkg update`: Refresh dependencies to newer versions if allowed by version constraints.
   - `mypkg clean`: Clear unused cached packages from the CAS directory.

5. **Lockfile Management**
   - Store resolved versions, hashes, and metadata in a lockfile to ensure consistent installations.
   - Use the lockfile to bypass re-resolution for already resolved dependencies.

---

## **Project Deliverables for Each Phase**

### **Phase 1: Parsing Metadata**

- A metadata file format (e.g., `mypkg.json`) with proper validation and initialization.
- A CLI command (`mypkg init`) for setting up new projects.

### **Phase 2: Managing Dependencies**

- A dependency resolver to match version ranges and retrieve content hashes.
- CLI commands to add, update, and remove dependencies.
- A lockfile to store resolved versions and content hashes.

### **Phase 3: Installation with CAS**

- A local CAS storage system for packages, optimized for deduplication.
- CLI commands for installing, updating, and managing dependencies.
- A structured local directory for installed dependencies (`mypkg_modules`).

---

## **Key Features Across Phases**

- **Consistency**: The lockfile ensures the same dependency versions are installed every time.
- **Integrity**: CAS verifies package authenticity using content hashes.
- **Efficiency**: Deduplication reduces redundant downloads and storage.
